## Meeting 3

- **Date:** 4-4-2025  
- **Time:** 2:15 PM
- **Environment:** [TA]
- **Summary:** Everyone shared their progress this week and plan for next week. We discussed our general approach to next week's tasking and cleared up some confusions.
- **Additional Info:**
  - This week's focus was basic UI and functionality.
  - Most pages have workable layout.
  - Basic back-end functionality is complete. There are api routes for login and register, and these interact with the database.
  - The plan for next week is to have the first iteration on the major features complete. This will give us time to polish and debug in week 4.
  - We were reminded that it is important to open a new issue/branch for each bugfix.
