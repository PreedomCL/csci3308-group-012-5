- **Time:** 2:15 PM
- **Environment:** [TA] [GROUP] 
- **Summary:** Everyone shared their progress this week and plan for next week. We discussed our approach to finishing the project.
- **Additional Info:**
  - This week's focus was on getting major features to function, getting the calendar and calendar download to function, changing page display depending on if user is a tutor or student, finishing up the recommendation algorithm, and finishing the external login and email notifications. 
  - The pages have workable layout and interact with each other.
  - Most of the back-end functionality is complete. There are api routes for login and register and the profile page, and these interact with the updated database.
