Features we used AI to help with: general routes, matching algorithm, calendar display, calendar download, Google sign-in, and some styling. 

AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude were used as adaptive search engines for syntax and formatting
use cases as well as the explicit examples shown below.

Did not use all of the code below but wanted to cite it all.
Prompt:
how would I check if the user is a student in handlebars without eq or changing JS?
const potentialmatches = await db.any(
    SELECT u.Id, u.Name, u.Degree, u.Year, u.Bio, u.LearningStyle, u.Profileimage
     FROM users u
     WHERE u.Id != $1
       AND u.UserType != $2
       AND u.Degree = $3
       AND u.LearningStyle = $4
       AND u.Id NOT IN (
         SELECT TutorID FROM MatchedUsers WHERE UserID = $1
       ) LIMIT 3,
    [userID, userData.usertype, userData.degree, userData.learningstyle]
  ); 

ChatGPT Response:
 Use {{#if}} with specific block logic and check the UserType string directly in text
While you can’t directly compare values, you can do something like this for rendering conditionally:
{{#each potentialmatches}}
  {{#if UserType}}
    {{#if (UserType) }} <!-- This only checks truthiness -->
      {{!-- Render based on value in a string hacky way --}}
      {{!-- Just render the UserType and style it or act accordingly --}}
      {{#if (UserType)}}
        {{#unless (UserType "tutor")}} <!-- This won't work either unless helper is used -->
      {{/if}}
    {{/if}}
    <p>{{Name}} is a {{UserType}}</p>
  {{/if}}
{{/each}}
But again — you can't check if UserType == "student" in plain Handlebars.
✅ Absolute closest you can get visually without conditionals:
Just display the type and style or filter it with CSS/JS on the front end.
{{#each potentialmatches}}
  <p>
    {{Name}} 
    {{#if UserType}}({{UserType}}){{/if}}
  </p>
{{/each}}
Then in your browser, use JS or CSS to act based on the value of UserType.
TL;DR
There’s no way to compare strings in vanilla Handlebars without using a helper or modifying your JS. You’ll need to:
Use a helper like eq, or
Preprocess with flags in JS, or
Handle it with frontend logic (e.g., filter or hide via JS after rendering).
Let me know if you'd be okay with a tiny inline helper — that's the most elegant fix.

is there a way I can keep this verbatim and just slightly move it to the left

ChatGPT Response:
Yes — if you want to keep your markup verbatim and just shift the block slightly left, the cleanest way is to add a Bootstrap utility class or a tiny inline style to offset it. Here are two minimal options:
✅ Option 1: Use Bootstrap's negative margin class
Just add this class to the outer <div class="card-vert">:
<div class="card-vert ms-n2">
ms-n2 = "margin start -2", shifts the card slightly to the left.
✅ Option 2: Use a tiny inline left margin tweak
If you want pixel-level control:
<div class="card-vert" style="margin-left: -8px;">
Both approaches will nudge the card left to align better with the ones above. Start with -8px and adjust if needed. Let me know if you'd like to match spacing exactly based on computed styles.

const allMatches = await db.query('SELECT * FROM MatchedUsers');
how do I use the handlebars each operator properly to go through all matches? I want it to loop through all matched users 

ChatGPT Response:
✅ 1. Update Your Backend Query
You're currently doing:
const allMatches = await db.query('SELECT * FROM MatchedUsers');
But that gives you just the matched user IDs, not the actual user info you want to display.
To loop through all matched users for the logged-in user, join MatchedUsers with Users to get their names, bios, etc.
Try this:
const allMatches = await db.any(
  `SELECT u.Id, u.Name, u.Degree, u.Year, u.Bio, u.LearningStyle
   FROM users u
   INNER JOIN MatchedUsers m ON u.Id = m.TutorID
   WHERE m.UserID = $1`,
  [userID]
);
This gives you all the user info for people matched to the current user (by UserID).
✅ 2. Pass allMatches to Your Template
res.render('yourTemplateFile', {
  allMatches: allMatches
});
✅ 3. Update Your Handlebars Template
{{#each allMatches}}

Prompt:
How would I get it to show users that you have liked and haven't liked or skipped and limit the amount of potential matches shown in the handlebars to 3??

ChatGPT Response:
 Updated Query for Only “Liked” Matches:
Replace your query with this:
const allMatches = await db.any(
  `SELECT u.Id, u.Name, u.Degree, u.Year, u.Bio, u.LearningStyle
   FROM users u
   INNER JOIN MatchedUsers m ON u.Id = m.TutorID
   WHERE m.UserID = $1 AND m.Action = 'like'`,
  [userID]
);
This ensures:
You're only getting matched users where Action = 'like'
You're filtering by the current user's UserID
Limit in the Backend (Best Performance)
Modify your query like this:
const potentialmatches = await db.any(
  `SELECT u.Id, u.Name, u.Degree, u.Year, u.Bio, u.LearningStyle
   FROM users u
   WHERE u.Id != $1
     AND u.UserType != $2
     AND u.Degree = $3
     AND u.LearningStyle = $4
     AND u.Id NOT IN (
       SELECT TutorID FROM MatchedUsers WHERE UserID = $1
     )
   LIMIT 3`,
  [userID, userData.usertype, userData.degree, userData.learningstyle]
);
Then just loop through potentialmatches in Handlebars as normal:
{{#each potentialmatches}}
  <!-- display each potential match -->
{{/each}}

     WHERE m.UserID = $1 AND m.Action = 'like',
    [userID, profileimage: result.profileimage]
  );
how would I read in profile image and add it to my handlebars

ChatGPT Response:
Fix Your Backend Query and Data Passing
Your current query is good, but this part:
[userID, profileimage: result.profileimage]
is not valid syntax for pg-promise parameters. You only need to pass [userID] if that’s the only placeholder in your SQL.
If you're trying to include the profile image in your result set, you’ve already done that with:
SELECT u.Id, u.Name, u.Degree, u.Year, u.Bio, u.LearningStyle, u.Profileimage
So just keep:
const allMatches = await db.any(
  `SELECT u.Id, u.Name, u.Degree, u.Year, u.Bio, u.LearningStyle, u.Profileimage
   FROM users u
   INNER JOIN MatchedUsers m ON u.Id = m.TutorID
   WHERE m.UserID = $1 AND m.Action = 'like'`,
  [userID]
);
Then pass it to your template:
res.render('yourTemplate', {
  allMatches: allMatches
});

Problem
You're checking:
if (!req.body.username) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Email is required' });
}
But your frontend or test is sending email in the body, not username. So req.body.username is undefined, which triggers the "Email is required" response.
✅ Fix
You just need to change the key back to email:
if (!req.body.email) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Email is required' });
}
const email = req.body.email.toLowerCase();

Copilot (Claude and ChatGPT)
Prompt:
what will this return if no match is found?

Copilot Response:
The code in question is this part of the `/login` route:

```javascript
const user = await db.one(userQuery, req.body.username);
```

The `db.one` method from `pg-promise` is used here. If no match is found for the query (`SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = $1`), `db.one` will throw an error. Specifically, it will throw a `QueryResultError` with the code `QueryResultErrorCode.NoData`.

This means that if no user is found with the provided username, the `catch` block will be executed, logging the error and redirecting the user to the `/register` page:

```javascript
catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  res.redirect('/register');
}
```

So, if no match is found, the user will be redirected to the `/register` page.

Prompt:
@workspace How can I reference the database used in the index.js file

Copilot Response:
To reference the database used in the `index.js` file, you need to import the database connection into your `server.spec.js` file. The issue is that your test file is trying to use `db.query()` but the `db` variable is not defined in your test file.

Here's how you can fix this:

````javascript
// filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/test/server.spec.js
// ********************** Initialize server **********************************

const server = require("../src/index"); //TODO: Make sure the path to your index.js is correctly added

// ********************** Import Libraries ***********************************

const chai = require("chai"); // Chai HTTP provides an interface for live integration testing of the API's.
const chaiHttp = require("chai-http");
chai.should();
chai.use(chaiHttp);
const { assert, expect } = chai;

// Import the database connection from index.js
const pgp = require('pg-promise')();
const dbConfig = {
  host: 'db',
  port: 5432,
  database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB,
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
};
const db = pgp(dbConfig);

// ********************** DEFAULT WELCOME TESTCASE ****************************
````

Alternatively, if you want to share the exact same database connection instance as in your `index.js`, you could modify your `index.js` to export the database connection:

````javascript
// filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/index.js
// At the end of your file, modify the exports:
module.exports = {
  app: app.listen(3000),
  db: db
};
````

And then in your test file:

````javascript
// filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/test/server.spec.js
// ********************** Initialize server **********************************

const { app, db } = require("../src/index"); // Import both server and db
const server = app; // Use the app as the server
````

This approach avoids duplicating the database connection logic but requires changes to both files. The first approach is simpler if you just want to fix the tests without changing the main application code.

================================================================================

Prompt:
Is one a better practice?

Copilot Response:
Both approaches are valid, but there are some important considerations for each:

### Approach 1: Import database configuration in test file

```javascript
// In server.spec.js
const pgp = require('pg-promise')();
const dbConfig = {
  host: 'db',
  port: 5432,
  database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB,
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
};
const db = pgp(dbConfig);
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement without modifying the main application code
- Keeps the test file self-contained
- Doesn't require changes to the production code just for testing

**Cons:**
- Creates a separate database connection (might have different state than the one used by the app)
- Duplicates configuration code
- Potential for configuration drift if database settings change in one file but not the other

### Approach 2: Export database from index.js

```javascript
// In index.js
module.exports = {
  app: app.listen(3000),
  db: db
};

// In server.spec.js
const { app, db } = require("../src/index");
```

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth for database connection
- Tests use the exact same connection as the application
- No configuration duplication
- Database state is consistent between tests and application

**Cons:**
- Requires changing the main application code
- Creates tighter coupling between test and application code

### Better Practice

For testing purposes, **Approach 2 (exporting the db from index.js)** is generally considered better practice because:

1. It ensures your tests are using the exact same database configuration as your application
2. If database connection details change, you only update them in one place
3. It avoids potential inconsistencies between test and application environments
4. It's more maintainable in the long run

This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and creates a cleaner separation of concerns where your database connection logic is defined once and exported where needed.

If you're concerned about modifying production code for tests, you could also consider a third approach: extracting database configuration to a separate module that both your application and tests import.

Prompt:
@workspace /fix  why is a response never going through?

Copilot Response:
Looking at the selected code and the surrounding context, the issue is that you're setting `res.status(400).statusMessage` but you're not actually sending a response back to the client. You need to call `res.send()` or a similar method to complete the HTTP response cycle.

## The Problem

In your validation code, when a required argument is missing, you set the status code and message but don't send anything back to the client:

```javascript
if(!registerInfo[arg]) {
  res.status(400).statusMessage = `argument "${arg}" is required`;
  return; // This just returns from the function, not sending a response
}
```

## Solution

Let's fix this by properly sending the error response:

```javascript
// Plan:
// 1. Modify the code to send a proper HTTP response with res.status().send()
// 2. Apply this same pattern to all the validation error cases in the function
```

````javascript
// filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/index.js
// ensure all arguments are present
  for(let arg in registerInfo) {
    if(!registerInfo[arg]) {
      return res.status(400).send(`argument "${arg}" is required`);
    }
  }
````

You should apply the same pattern to all other validation checks in the function. Each place where you're currently setting `res.status(400).statusMessage` should be replaced with `return res.status(400).send()`.

This completes the HTTP response cycle by actually sending the response back to the client instead of just setting the status and message but not sending anything.

    -- filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/init_data/insert.sql
    INSERT INTO Classes (Name) VALUES
    ('Math'),
    ('History'),
    ('Compsci'),
    ('Engineering'),
    ('Business');
    
    INSERT INTO LearningStyles (Name) VALUES
    ('Visual'),
    ('Auditory'),
    ('Hands'),
    ('Writing');
    ````
    
    Change all the double quotes to single quotes and the error should be resolved.

Prompt:
  How can I combine these queries so that if any fail the whole operation fails?

Copilot Response:
  You can use PostgreSQL transactions to ensure atomicity of your database operations. With a transaction, if any query fails, all changes can be rolled back, ensuring data consistency.
    
    Here's how you can modify your `/register` endpoint to use transactions:
    
    ````javascript
    // filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/index.js
    // ...existing code...
    
    app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
      // All validation code remains the same
      // ...
    
      // After all validation passes:
      try {
        // Start a transaction
        await db.tx(async t => {
          // ensure that the email doesn't already exists
          const emailQuery = 'SELECT Id FROM Users WHERE Email = $1';
          const emailResult = await t.manyOrNone(emailQuery, registerInfo.email);
    
          if (emailResult.length > 0) {
            // This will cause the transaction to roll back
            throw new Error('An account is already registered with this email');
          }
    
          // hash the password using bcrypt library
          const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
    
          // insert the user data into the db
          const insertUserQuery = 'INSERT INTO Users (Password, Email, UserType, Name, Degree, Year, Bio, LearningStyle) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8)';
          await t.none(insertUserQuery, [
            passwordHash,
            registerInfo.email,
            registerInfo.type,
            registerInfo.name,
            registerInfo.degree,
            registerInfo.year,
            registerInfo.bio,
            registerInfo.learning
          ]);
    
          // get the userId for the user we just created
          const userIdQuery = 'SELECT Id FROM Users WHERE Email = $1';
          const userId = await t.one(userIdQuery, registerInfo.email);
    
          // insert the class to user mappings
          const insertClassesToUsersQuery = 'INSERT INTO ClassesToUsers (ClassId, UserId) VALUES ($1, $2)';
          for(let classId of registerInfo.classes) {
            await t.none(insertClassesToUsersQuery, [classId, userId.id]);
          }
    
          // If we reach here without errors, the transaction will be committed
        });
    
        // Transaction was successful
        res.redirect('/login');
      } catch (error) {
        // Any error will cause the transaction to roll back
        console.log(`Server encountered error during register: ${error}`);
        
        if (error.message === 'An account is already registered with this email') {
          res.status(400).send(error.message);
        } else {
          res.status(500).send('The server encountered an error while registering the user');
        }
      }
    });
    
    // ...existing code...
    ````
    
    The key changes are:
    
    1. Using `db.tx()` to start a database transaction
    2. Changing all database queries to use the transaction object (`t`) instead of `db`
    3. If any query fails or throws an error, the entire transaction is automatically rolled back
    4. If all queries succeed, the transaction is automatically committed
    
    This approach ensures that either all database operations succeed together, or none of them take effect - preventing partial/inconsistent data in your database.

Prompt:
  axios call to make a test user

Copilot Response:
  You can add an axios call to create a test user for development or testing purposes. Here's how you could implement it at the end of your file:
    
    ````javascript
    // filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/index.js
    // ...existing code...
    
    app.listen(3000);
    console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
    
    // Create a test user on startup (for development purposes)
    const createTestUser = async () => {
      try {
        // Check if test user already exists
        const testEmail = 'testuser@example.com';
        const userExists = await db.oneOrNone('SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = $1', testEmail);
        
        if (!userExists) {
          console.log('Creating test user...');
          
          // Create test user using the same registration flow
          await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/register', {
            password: 'testpassword',
            email: testEmail,
            type: 'student',
            name: 'Test User',
            degree: 'Computer Science',
            year: 'senior',
            bio: 'This is a test user created automatically for development.',
            classes: ['compsci', 'math'],
            learning: 'visual'
          }, {
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
          });
          
          console.log('Test user created successfully');
        } else {
          console.log('Test user already exists');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('Error creating test user:', error.message);
      }
    };
    
    // Comment out the following line in production
    createTestUser();
    ````
    
    This code:
    
    1. Defines an async function `createTestUser` that:
       - Checks if a test user with the email 'testuser@example.com' already exists
       - If not, creates a new user using axios to make a POST request to your own `/register` endpoint
       - Includes all the required fields for registration
    
    2. The function is called immediately after server startup
    
    Important considerations:
    - This is for development purposes only and should be disabled in production
    - The axios call might fail on the first server startup because the server might not be ready to accept requests immediately - you might need additional error handling
    - You could modify this to create multiple test users with different roles or configurations

Prompt:
  @workspace /fix why isn't this script being called when the google sign in prompt is complete

Copilot Response:
  The issue is likely occurring because the Google Sign-In API is not properly initialized or the script for handling Google authentication isn't loading correctly. The spelling warnings for "glogin" and "idtoken" are likely false positives from your linter/editor and not the actual problem.
    
    Let's fix your Google Sign-In implementation:
    
    1. First, you need to include the Google Platform Library
    2. Configure the sign-in button properly
    3. Ensure your callback function is triggered
    
    Here's the updated code:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{! filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/views/pages/login.hbs }}
    <div class="container mt-1">
    
    <form align="center" method="post" action="/login">
        <h1>Login</h1>
        <label for="Username">Username</label><br/>
        <input type="text" name="username"/><br/>
        <label for="password">Password</label><br/>
        <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type='submit'>Login</button><br/>
        <p>Don't have an account? <a href='/register'>Register</a></p> 
        <div id="g-signin2" class="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn"></div>
    </form>
    
    <!-- Add Google Platform Library -->
    <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script>
    <script>
        // Load the Google Sign-In API
        function gapiLoaded() {
            gapi.load('auth2', function() {
                gapi.auth2.init({
                    client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com' // Replace with your actual client ID
                }).then(function() {
                    // Render the sign-in button
                    gapi.signin2.render('g-signin2', {
                        'scope': 'profile email',
                        'width': 240,
                        'height': 50,
                        'longtitle': true,
                        'theme': 'dark',
                        'onsuccess': onSignIn,
                        'onfailure': function(error) {
                            console.log('Sign-in failure:', error);
                        }
                    });
                });
            });
        }
    
        function onSignIn(googleUser) {
            console.log("Google Login");
            let idToken = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token;
            var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhr.open('POST', '/glogin');
            xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
            xhr.onload = function() {
                console.log('Server response:', xhr.responseText);
                if (xhr.status === 200) {
                    window.location.href = '/dashboard'; // Redirect after successful login
                }
            };
            xhr.onerror = function() {
                console.error('Request error');
            };
            xhr.send('idtoken=' + idToken);
        }
    </script>
    <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js?onload=gapiLoaded" async defer></script>
    </div>
    ```
    
    Key changes:
    1. Added proper Google Sign-In API loading
    2. Added initialization of the Google Sign-In API with your client ID (you'll need to replace the placeholder)
    3. Added proper rendering of the sign-in button with explicit success and failure handlers
    4. Added response and error handlers to your XMLHttpRequest
    5. Made sure the Google Sign-In button has a specific ID for targeting
    
    Make sure to replace `'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'` with your actual Google OAuth client ID from the Google Cloud Console.

Prompt:
  @workspace /fix  why doesn't this work?

Copilot Response:
  The "Unknown word" warning for "glogin" is just a spell-checking alert, not an actual JavaScript error. It's not causing your functionality issues.
    
    Looking at your code more carefully, there are a few issues that could prevent the Google sign-in from working properly:
    
    1. You're not properly handling the fetch response
    2. You're making a request to "/glogin" but not properly handling the response
    3. You have two different Google sign-in implementations that might be conflicting
    
    Let's fix the issue with the `request.json()` call:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{! filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/views/pages/login.hbs }}
    <div class = "container mt-1">

        function handleCredentialResponse(response) {
            console.log("Encoded JWT ID token: " + response.credential);
            console.log(response);
    
            fetch("/glogin", {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json"
                },
                body: JSON.stringify(response)
            })
            .then(response => {
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok: ' + response.status);
                }
                return response.json();
            })
            .then(data => {
                console.log('Success:', data);
                // Redirect or handle successful login here
                window.location.href = "/dashboard"; // Adjust to your redirect page
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error('Error sending token to server:', error);
            });
        }
        window.onload = function () {
            google.accounts.id.initialize({
                client_id: "1070951263088-sp0gkgou33au2ufhhfmbtivduhd0tn3b.apps.googleusercontent.com",
                callback: handleCredentialResponse
            });
            google.accounts.id.renderButton(
                document.getElementById("gbutton"),
                { theme: "outline", size: "large" }  // customization attributes
            );
            google.accounts.id.prompt(); // also display the One Tap dialog
        }
    </script>
    
    <form align = "center" method="post" action="/login">
        <h1>Login</h1>
        <label for="Username">Username</label><br/>
        <input type="text" name="username"/><br/>
        <label for="password">Password</label><br/>
        <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>
        <button class = "btn btn-primary"  type='submit'>Login</button><br/>

    <!-- Remove the second implementation since it's not being used -->
    <!--

    <script>
        function onSignIn(googleUser) {
            console.log("Google Login");
            let idToken = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token;
            
        }
    </script>
    -->
    </div>
    ```
    
    The main issues fixed:
    
    1. Replaced `new Request()` with the more commonly used `fetch()` API
    2. Added proper error handling for the fetch request
    3. Added proper response handling to process the server response
    4. Added proper headers to indicate JSON content
    5. Commented out the second Google sign-in implementation that wasn't being used
    
    Make sure your server has a route that handles POST requests to `/glogin` and processes the authentication token properly. The server should verify the token with Google's servers and create a session for the user.

Prompt:
  @workspace /fix The JSON isn't parsing

Copilot Response:
  The error about "glogin" is just a spell checker warning, not a JavaScript error. The real issue is that your JSON isn't parsing correctly.
    
    Let's improve your code to handle the response properly:
    
    ```javascript
    // filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/resources/js/glogin.js

            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(response)
        }).then(async response => {
            if(response.ok) {
                try {
                    const data = await response.json();
                    console.log('Response data:', data);
                    
                    if (data.redirect) {
                        window.location.href = data.redirect;
                    } else {
                        console.error('No redirect URL in response');
                    }
                } catch (e) {
                    console.error('JSON parsing error:', e);
                    
                    // Let's also try to see the raw response
                    const text = await response.clone().text();
                    console.log('Raw response:', text);
                }
            } else {
                console.error('Server returned error status:', response.status);
                const errorText = await response.text();
                console.error('Error details:', errorText);
            }
        }).catch(error => {
            console.error('Network or fetch error:', error);
        });
    };
    
    window.onload = () => {
        google.accounts.id.initialize({
            client_id: "1070951263088-sp0gkgou33au2ufhhfmbtivduhd0tn3b.apps.googleusercontent.com",
            callback: handleCredentialResponse
        });
        
        const buttonElement = document.getElementById("gbutton");
        if (buttonElement) {
            google.accounts.id.renderButton(
                buttonElement,
                { theme: "outline", size: "large" }  // customization attributes
            );
            google.accounts.id.prompt(); // also display the One Tap dialog
        } else {
            console.error("Google button element not found");
        }
    };
    ```
    
    Key improvements:
    1. Added proper error handling for JSON parsing
    2. Added error handling for the fetch request
    3. Added a check to verify the button element exists
    4. Added better logging to help diagnose issues
    5. Fixed variable declaration for `data` to use `const`
    6. Added logging of the raw response when JSON parsing fails
    
    The issue is likely that your server isn't returning valid JSON. This could happen if:
    
    1. The server is returning HTML instead of JSON (like an error page)
    2. The server is returning malformed JSON
    3. The response has a Content-Type header that doesn't match "application/json"
    4. The server isn't returning anything
    
    With the logging improvements, you'll be able to see exactly what's coming back from the server and fix it.

Prompt:
  Handlebars if object is passed

Copilot Response:
  It looks like you're trying to use Handlebars' `if` conditionals to conditionally display content based on whether an `email` variable is passed to the template. However, there's an issue with how you're using it:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{#if email}}
    {{}}  <!-- This is empty and doesn't do anything -->
    <div class="form-group col-md-6">
        <label for="email_input">Email</label> <br/>
        <input type="text" name="email" class="form-control" id="email_input" placeholder="Enter email"> 
    </div>
    ```
    
    ## How to Fix the Handlebars Conditional
    
    Here's how to properly use the Handlebars `if` statement:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{#if email}}
        <!-- Content to show if email exists -->
        <div class="form-group col-md-6">
            <label for="email_input">Email</label> <br/>
            <input type="text" name="email" class="form-control" id="email_input" value="{{email}}" placeholder="Enter email"> 
        </div>
    {{else}}
        <!-- Content to show if email doesn't exist -->
        <div class="form-group col-md-6">
            <label for="email_input">Email</label> <br/>
            <input type="text" name="email" class="form-control" id="email_input" placeholder="Enter email"> 
        </div>
    {{/if}}
    ```
    
    If you're trying to check if an email object exists before displaying these fields:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{#if email}}
        <div class="form-group col-md-6">
            <label for="email_input">Email</label> <br/>
            <input type="text" name="email" class="form-control" id="email_input" value="{{email}}" placeholder="Enter email"> 
        </div>
    
        <div class="form-group col-md-6">
            <label for="password_input">Password</label> 
            <input type="password" name="password" class="form-control" id="password_input" placeholder="Enter password">
        </div>
    {{/if}}
    ```
    
    ## Checking for Object Properties
    
    If you want to check if a property exists on an object:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{#if user.email}}
        <!-- Content to show if user.email exists -->
    {{else}}
        <!-- Content to show if user.email doesn't exist -->
    {{/if}}
    ```
    
    ## Checking if an Object Exists
    
    If you want to check if an entire object exists:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{#if user}}
        <!-- Content to show if user exists -->
    {{else}}
        <!-- Content to show if user doesn't exist -->
    {{/if}}
    ```
    
    Remember that in Handlebars, the `if` helper checks if the value is truthy. Empty objects are truthy, so if you need to check if an object has properties, you might need a custom helper.

Prompt:
  constraint to require either password or google id

Copilot Response:
  You're looking to add a constraint to ensure that a user must have either a password or a GoogleId (or both). Here's how you can modify your Users table definition to implement this constraint:
    
    ````sql
    -- filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/init_data/create.sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Users;
    CREATE TABLE Users (
      Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      Password VARCHAR(60),
      Email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      UserType VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Degree VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Year VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Bio VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
      LearningStyle INT NOT NULL REFERENCES LearningStyles(Id),
      GoogleId VARCHAR(19),
      CONSTRAINT password_or_google_id CHECK (Password IS NOT NULL OR GoogleId IS NOT NULL)
    );
    ````
    
    This adds a CHECK constraint named `password_or_google_id` which ensures that at least one of the two fields must contain a value. This way, users can authenticate either through a password or through Google authentication, but they must have at least one authentication method available.

================================================================================

Prompt:
  what if i want password xor googleid

Copilot Response:
  If you want to enforce an XOR constraint (exactly one of password or GoogleId, but not both), you can modify the Users table definition like this:
    
    ````sql
    -- filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/init_data/create.sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Users;
    CREATE TABLE Users (
      Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      Password VARCHAR(60),
      Email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      UserType VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
      Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Degree VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Year VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Bio VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
      LearningStyle INT NOT NULL REFERENCES LearningStyles(Id),
      GoogleId VARCHAR(19),
      CONSTRAINT password_xor_googleid CHECK (
        (Password IS NULL AND GoogleId IS NOT NULL) OR
        (Password IS NOT NULL AND GoogleId IS NULL)
      )
    );
    ````
    
    This CHECK constraint ensures that:
    - If Password is NULL, then GoogleId must NOT be NULL
    - If Password is NOT NULL, then GoogleId must be NULL
    
    This way, each user must have exactly one authentication method - either a password or a Google ID, but never both.

Prompt:
  @terminal /explain #terminalSelection

Copilot Response:
  Looking at your terminal selection and the code, I see you're executing a SQL query to retrieve a user by email. Here's what you need to know about this:
    
    ## SQL Query Analysis
    
    The query in your terminal selection is:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = "cupr1663@colorado.edu"
    ```
    
    This query has a couple of issues:
    
    1. In PostgreSQL (which you're using based on your Docker configuration), string literals should use single quotes (`'`) instead of double quotes (`"`). Double quotes are used for identifiers like column names.
    
    2. The way your application is configured (looking at lines 325-348 in index.js), your app uses parameterized queries with `$1` placeholders, which is a much safer approach.
    
    ## Corrected Query
    
    To properly query for this user in your PostgreSQL database, you should use:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = 'cupr1663@colorado.edu';
    ```
    
    ## Application Context
    
    In your application code, this query is handled in the `/login` route with proper parameter binding:
    
    ```javascript
    const userQuery = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = $1';
    const user = await db.oneOrNone(userQuery, email);
    ```
    
    This is the correct way to handle SQL queries as it prevents SQL injection attacks.
    
    ## Docker Context
    
    I noticed your last command was `sudo docker compose down -v`, which took down your containers and removed volumes. If you want to run the SQL query now, you'll need to restart your Docker environment with:
    
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    Then you can connect to your database container to execute SQL queries.

Prompt:
  This pattern isn't stopping the submission

Copilot Response:
  # Issue with Email Pattern Validation
    
    I see that the email validation pattern isn't working as expected. The pattern is correct, but there are a few issues that could be causing the validation to fail:
    
    1. The commented-out validation script at the bottom is crucial for making client-side validation work properly
    2. The `input` type should be `email` rather than `text` for better browser validation support
    3. You might need to add `novalidate` to the form to ensure Bootstrap's custom validation works correctly
    
    Here's how to fix it:
    
    1. First, change the input type from `text` to `email`:
    
    ```handlebars
    <!-- filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/views/pages/login.hbs -->
    <input type="email" name="email" class="form-control" pattern="^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$" required/>
    ```
    
    2. Uncomment the JavaScript validation code at the bottom of the page - it's needed for Bootstrap's validation to work properly
    
    3. Add `novalidate` to the form to ensure Bootstrap's custom validation takes precedence:
    
    ```handlebars
    <!-- filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/views/pages/login.hbs -->
    <form class="needs-validation" method="post" action="/login" novalidate>
    ```
    
    These changes should ensure the email validation works properly and prevents form submission when the pattern doesn't match.

================================================================================

Prompt:
  does this default to "db" is the env var is not found?

Copilot Response:
  The code you've highlighted has an issue. The current line:
    
    ```javascript
    host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST | "db"
    ```
    
    uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) instead of the logical OR operator (`||`). With the bitwise OR, it won't work as intended to provide a default value when the environment variable is not found.
    
    To fix this and properly default to "db" when the environment variable is not found, you should change it to:
    
    ```javascript
    // filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/index.js
    host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST || "db", // the database server
    ```
    
    The logical OR operator (`||`) will return the first truthy value, so if `process.env.POSTGRES_HOST` is undefined or empty, it will use "db" as the fallback value.

================================================================================

Prompt:
  handlbars foreach example

Copilot Response:
  # Handlebars {{#each}} Example for message.hbs
    
    The current code uses `{{#foreach}}` which is incorrect syntax in Handlebars. You should use `{{#each}}` instead. Here's how to properly implement an iteration over notifications:
    
    ```handlebars
    {{! filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/views/partials/message.hbs }}
    {{#each notifications}}
      <div class="notification {{type}}">
        <p>{{message}}</p>
        {{#if timestamp}}
          <small>{{timestamp}}</small>
        {{/if}}
      </div>
    {{else}}
      <!-- This block runs if notifications array is empty -->
      <div class="no-notifications">No notifications available</div>
    {{/each}}
    ```
    
    Key points about Handlebars `each` helper:
    - Use `{{#each}}` to iterate over an array
    - Inside the block, you can access properties of each item directly
    - The `{{else}}` section is optional and will display if the array is empty
    - You can access the current array index using `{{@index}}`
    - You can access the current item's key using `{{@key}}` when iterating over objects
    
    Make sure when you render your template, you pass the notifications array correctly:
    
    ```javascript
    res.render('yourTemplate', { notifications: notificationsArray });
    ```

Prompt:
  When I add the calendar to the dom, it overflows it's container in Firefox but not in chrome or safari

Copilot Response:
  # Calendar Overflow in Firefox
    
    This sounds like a browser-specific CSS rendering issue. The way Firefox handles container sizing and overflow can be different from Chrome and Safari. Here are a few fixes you could try:
    
    ## Option 1: Add explicit height and overflow settings
    
    Update your `initializeCalendar` function to add explicit CSS after rendering:
    
    ```javascript
    // filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/resources/js/script.js
    async function initializeCalendar(){
      /* add time slots */
      console.log("DOM loaded, initializing calendar...");
      const calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');
    
      // Check if FullCalendar library is available
      if (typeof FullCalendar === 'undefined') {
          console.error("FullCalendar library not loaded");
          return; // Exit early if library isn't loaded
      }
      const userID = document.getElementById("calendar").getAttribute("data-user-id");
      const userName = document.getElementById("calendar").getAttribute("data-user-name");
    
      const response = await fetch(`/calendar/events?userID=${userID}`);
      console.log("cal done");
      const userEvents = await response.json();
    
      try {
          console.log("Creating calendar instance...");
          calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {  
              initialView: 'timeGridWeek',
              // ...existing config...
              height: 'auto', // Change from '100%' to 'auto'
              // ...rest of existing config...
          });
    
          console.log("Rendering calendar...");
          calendar.render();
          
          // Firefox-specific fixes
          const fcScrollgrid = calendarEl.querySelector('.fc-scrollgrid');
          if (fcScrollgrid) {
            fcScrollgrid.style.overflowX = 'hidden';
            fcScrollgrid.style.maxWidth = '100%';
          }
          
          console.log("Calendar render complete");
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error creating calendar:", error);
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Option 2: Add CSS to your stylesheet
    
    Add these styles to your CSS file to fix Firefox's handling of the calendar:
    
    ```css
    /* Firefox-specific fixes */
    @-moz-document url-prefix() {
      .fc-scrollgrid {
        overflow-x: hidden !important;
        max-width: 100% !important;
      }
      
      .fc-scroller {
        overflow: visible !important;
      }
      
      .fc-view-harness {
        overflow: hidden;
        max-width: 100%;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Option 3: Update initialization with responsive settings
    
    Change your calendar initialization with more responsive settings:
    
    ```javascript
    // filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/resources/js/script.js
    async function initializeCalendar(){
      // ...existing code...
      
      try {
          console.log("Creating calendar instance...");
          calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {  
              initialView: 'timeGridWeek',
              // ...other settings...
              
              // Responsive settings
              height: 'auto',
              contentHeight: 'auto',
              expandRows: true,
              handleWindowResize: true,
              
              // Add this to fix Firefox issues
              views: {
                timeGridWeek: {
                  dayMaxEventRows: true,
                  fixedWeekCount: false
                }
              },
              
              // ...rest of existing config...
          });
    
          // Render calendar
          calendar.render();
          
          // Add window resize handler for better Firefox compatibility
          window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
            setTimeout(() => calendar.updateSize(), 100);
          });
          
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error creating calendar:", error);
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Try these options to see which one resolves your Firefox overflow issue while maintaining the layout in Chrome and Safari.

Prompt:
  @workspace /fix why isn't this script working?

Copilot Response:
  Looking at your register.hbs file, I notice there are multiple script-related issues that could be causing problems:
    
    1. The script tag for "/resources/js/register.js" appears twice - once at line 117 and again within your selection
    2. The functionality for user type selection appears incomplete - there's an empty `onchange` attribute
    3. The displaySelectedImage function is defined after it's used in the HTML
    
    Let me look at the most likely problem:
    
    The main issue is probably that the `/resources/js/register.js` script reference is duplicated (once isolated at the bottom, once embedded in the inline script). This can cause conflicts if the script contains initialization code that runs more than once.
    
    I recommend:
    
    1. Keep only one script reference to register.js
    2. Move any inline JavaScript to the external file for better organization
    3. Ensure the script tag appears after the HTML elements it manipulates
    
    ```handlebars
    <!-- filepath: /home/curtis/csci/csci-3308/csci3308-group-012-5/ProjectSourceCode/src/views/pages/register.hbs -->
    <!-- Remove the duplicate script reference at line 117/118 and keep only one instance -->
    <!-- Keep the other script blocks or move their functionality to register.js -->
    ```
    
    If the script still doesn't work after removing the duplicate reference, check that:
    1. The path to register.js is correct
    2. The register.js file exists and contains the expected functionality
    3. There are no JavaScript errors in the browser console


BEGIN AI SOURCE = Claude
Prompt:
this is incrementing index from 1 to 11 not 1 to 2.
let index = req.body.index;
  console.log(index);
  index = index+1;
  console.log(index);
  res.redirect(/matching/${index});

Response:
Ah, I see the potential issue now. When receiving data from a form or request body, the value might be coming in as a string. Let's modify the code to ensure proper type conversion:

javascript
let index = req.body.index;
console.log(index);  // Log the original value
index = Number(index) + 1;  // Convert to number and increment
console.log(index);  // Log the incremented value
res.redirect(`/matching/${index}`);
The key change is using Number() to explicitly convert the input to a number before incrementing. This ensures that:

String inputs like "1" are converted to the number 1
Increment works as expected
Prevents unexpected string concatenation
Alternative approaches:

javascript
// Option 1: Unary plus operator
index = +index + 1;

// Option 2: parseInt
index = parseInt(index, 10) + 1;
The Number() method is generally the most straightforward and readable. Would you like me to explain more about type conversion in JavaScript?


Prompt:
I am running into an issue where I am trying to insert an entry to a PostgreSQL table with a primary key that already exists. I want to ignore these entries.

Response:
To handle potential duplicate entries, you can use an "upsert" or "INSERT ... ON CONFLICT" approach in PostgreSQL:
Ex:    INSERT INTO Matches (TutorID, StudentID, Status) 
        VALUES ($1, $2, 1)
        ON CONFLICT (TutorID, StudentID) DO NOTHING
        RETURNING TutorID, StudentID, Status
      `, [r.tutorid, userData.id]);


Prompt: center <h5>

Response:
To center an <h5> heading element, there are several CSS approaches you can use. Here are the most common methods:
The simplest way to center an <h5> heading is to use the CSS text-align: center property. Here are the different methods:

Using inline CSS (quickest for a single element):
html<h5 style="text-align: center;">Centered Heading</h5>

Using a CSS class (better for multiple elements):
html<style>
  .centered {
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>

<h5 class="centered">Centered Heading</h5>

Using a container with flexbox:
html<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <h5>Centered Heading</h5>
</div>

Using margin auto (if the heading needs a specific width):
html<h5 style="width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  Centered Heading
</h5>
For most cases, the first method (text-align: center) is the simplest and most appropriate for centering heading text.

Based on my search results, I've compiled a list of University of Colorado degree codes for different engineering departments. Let me create an artifact with these codes organized by department:


University of Colorado Boulder Engineering Department Codes
Code 
I've created a comprehensive list of University of Colorado Boulder engineering department codes based on my search results. This list includes all the major engineering departments at CU Boulder, with their corresponding four-letter codes that are used as prefixes for course numbers.

The list includes:

Aerospace Engineering (ASEN)
Applied Mathematics (APPM)
Architectural Engineering (AREN)
Chemical Engineering (CHEN)
Civil Engineering (CVEN)
Computer Science (CSCI)
Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECEN)
Environmental Engineering (EVEN)
General Engineering (GEEN)
Mechanical Engineering (MCEN)
Plus several other related departments and programs like Engineering Management (EMEN), Engineering Ethics & Society (ENES), and specialized programs.

These codes are used throughout the university for:

Course numbering (e.g., MCEN 2023 for Mechanical Engineering Statics course)
Identifying departments that manage specific courses
Registration and enrollment systems
Course substitutions between departments
You can use this list as a dropdown menu in your application, which will provide users with all the major engineering disciplines available at CU Boulder.

Prompt: repeat for general degree areas

Response:
I'll create a comprehensive list of general degree areas, similar to the previous engineering department codes list.

General Degree Areas (Academic Disciplines)
Code 
The list I've created covers all major academic disciplines and general degree areas that are commonly found at universities. These four-letter codes represent departments and degree programs that students can pursue.

The list includes traditional liberal arts disciplines (like History, Philosophy, English), social sciences (Psychology, Sociology, Political Science), natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), business fields (Accounting, Finance, Marketing), and arts (Music, Dance, Theatre).

Each code follows the standard four-letter format used by many universities for course prefixes and department designations. They're organized alphabetically for easy navigation.

This comprehensive list would work well in a dropdown menu for any application where users need to select their academic discipline or field of study. It covers the major areas without being overly specific or redundant.

Would you like me to modify this list in any way? I could add more specialized disciplines, group them by category, or adjust them to better match a specific university's coding system if needed.

Prompt: replace the value with the text displayed

Response: 
I'll modify the list so that the value attribute matches the displayed text for each option.


Broad Academic Areas (Values Match Text)
Code 

<option value="ACCT">Accounting (ACCT)</option> <option value="APRD">Advertising, PR, Media Design (APRD)</option> <option value="ASEN">Aerospace Engineering (ASEN)</option> <option value="AIRR">Air Force Aerospace Studies (AIRR)</option

Prompt: for the above options, write the value in form:
('math'),
('history'),
('compsci'),
('engineering'),

Response:
I'll convert the list of option values into the format you requested. Here's the result:

Formatted Department Codes
Code 
I've formatted all the department codes from the provided list into the requested format. Each department code is surrounded by parentheses and single quotes, followed by a comma, matching the example format you provided:

('MATH'),
('HIST'),
('CSCI'),
('ENGR'),
This format is commonly used for SQL inserts or when defining constants in various programming languages. The artifact contains the complete list of all 147 department codes from your original document, maintaining their original order.


Prompt: can i have a modal on top of a modal

Response:
Yes, you can have a modal on top of another modal, which is often called a "nested modal" or "stacked modal." However, there are some considerations to make this work properly:
Standard Solution Using Bootstrap
If you're using Bootstrap, you can create nested modals by setting the backdrop option to 'static' for the second modal. This prevents the backdrop from closing the parent modal:
javascript// Open the first modal
const firstModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('first-modal'));
firstModal.show();

// Then open the second modal from within the first
document.getElementById('open-nested-modal').addEventListener('click', function() {
  const secondModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('second-modal'), {
    backdrop: 'static' // Prevents clicking outside the modal from closing it
  });
  secondModal.show();
});
Z-index Management
You'll need to manage the z-index of your modals to ensure proper stacking:
css/* Normal modal z-index in Bootstrap is 1050 */
.modal {
  z-index: 1050;
}

/* First modal backdrop */
.modal-backdrop {
  z-index: 1040;
}

/* Second modal should appear above the first */
.second-modal {
  z-index: 1060;
}

/* Second modal backdrop */
.second-modal + .modal-backdrop {
  z-index: 1055;
}


Prompt: i want the background modal to fade like the rest of the background does

Response:
To make the background modal fade like the rest of the background, you need to modify your approach slightly. The issue is that when setting backdrop: false on the nested modal, it removes the fading background effect entirely.

You'll need to add some CSS to adjust how the backdrops stack:
css/* Make sure the second modal's backdrop appears on top of the first modal */
.modal-backdrop + .modal-backdrop {
  z-index: 1052;
}

/* Ensure the second modal appears on top of its backdrop */
#request-modal {
  z-index: 1053;
}
The key is to allow both modals to have their own backdrop with the fading effect, but control the z-index values so they stack properly. This way, when you open the second modal, it will have its own fading backdrop effect that sits on top of the first modal.
If you're still having issues, you might need to adjust the actual HTML structure. Make sure the request modal is defined outside of the first modal in your HTML.

Based on the screenshot you provided, I've made several improvements to the calendar stylesheet to address specific issues and enhance the overall appearance. The main problems I noticed were:

The events have truncated text (showing only "Ava..." instead of "Available")
The current blue color scheme needed to be preserved
The time slots could use better sizing
The day headers could be more prominent
Here's a summary of the improvements:

Color Matching: Adjusted the color palette to match your existing blue theme instead of introducing new colors
Event Display:
Fixed the truncated "Available" text by improving title container width
Added minimum width to events so they always show complete text
Improved spacing and formatting of time labels
Header Enhancements:
Made the title larger and better centered
Applied proper styling to the "Update Availability" button
Time Grid Improvements:
Increased time slot height for better visibility
Improved time label contrast for better readability
Added subtle alternating row backgrounds for easier time tracking
Day Header Styling:
Improved day name visibility
Added subtle weekend highlighting
Enhanced current day highlighting to match your blue theme
Visual Enhancements:
Added a subtle gradient to events for more dimension
Improved spacing and padding throughout
The updated stylesheet preserves your existing design while fixing these issues. You can integrate these changes with your current implementation to achieve a more polished calendar appearance.

Prompt: Debug: Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON

Response:
I see the specific error message now: "Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"

This is a common error when a server returns an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON. The response starts with <!DOCTYPE html> which is causing the JSON parsing to fail. This typically happens when:

The server route is returning an error page (like a 404 or 500 error)
The endpoint might be temporarily unavailable
There could be authentication issues

Prompt: let formatted_event = {
          title: event.title,
          daysOfWeek: event.days,
          description: event.description,
          startTime: event.start,
          endTime: event.end,
          type: event.type,
          id: event.id,
          format: event.format
        }

update this for Full Calendar event so that daysOfWeek is just a single integer representing the day

Response: 
To update the formatted_event object for Full Calendar where daysOfWeek should be a single integer representing the day rather than an array, you'll need to modify that property:

javascript
let formatted_event = {
  title: event.title,
  daysOfWeek: [event.days[0]], // Take the first day from the array as a single-item array
  description: event.description,
  startTime: event.start,
  endTime: event.end,
  type: event.type,
  id: event.id,
  format: event.format
}


Prompt: I am using bootstrap modal - how do i make it wider

Response:
To make a Bootstrap modal wider, you can override the default width using custom CSS. Here are a few approaches:

Option 1: Use Bootstrap's built-in modal size classes

html
<!-- Add "modal-lg" class for a larger modal -->
<div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">
    <!-- modal content -->
</div>

<!-- Or "modal-xl" for an extra large modal -->
<div class="modal-dialog modal-xl">
    <!-- modal content -->
</div>
Option 2: Custom CSS

css
/* For a specific modal */
#yourModalId .modal-dialog {
    max-width: 80%; /* or any specific width like 800px */
    width: 80%;
}

/* Or for all modals */
.modal-dialog {
    max-width: 80%;
    width: 80%;
}
Option 3: Inline style

html
<div class="modal-dialog" style="max-width: 80%; width: 80%;">
    <!-- modal content -->
</div>
Remember that the modal structure in Bootstrap typically looks like:

html
<div class="modal" id="exampleModal">
  <div class="modal-dialog">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <!-- Header, body and footer -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
You want to adjust the width of the modal-dialog element, not the outer modal container.


Prompt: custom properties in fullcalendar

Response:
FullCalendar allows you to include custom properties in your event objects that aren't part of the standard FullCalendar event model. These custom properties can be useful for storing additional data that you might need when interacting with events.

Here's how you can work with custom properties in FullCalendar:

Adding Custom Properties
When defining your events, simply include any additional properties you need:

javascript
let events = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Available',
    start: '2023-04-10T10:00:00',
    end: '2023-04-10T12:00:00',
    // Custom properties
    type: 'Available',
    format: 'Hybrid',
    location: 'Room 101',
    priority: 2,
    createdBy: 'user123'
  }
];
Accessing Custom Properties
You can access these properties in various FullCalendar callbacks:

javascript
const calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
  // Other calendar options...
  
  eventClick: function(info) {
    // Access custom properties from the event object
    const eventType = info.event.extendedProps.type;
    const format = info.event.extendedProps.format;
    
    console.log(`Clicked on ${info.event.title}, Type: ${eventType}, Format: ${format}`);
  },
  
  eventRender: function(info) {
    // Use custom properties to conditionally style events
    if (info.event.extendedProps.format === 'Hybrid') {
      info.el.style.backgroundColor = '#8e44ad';
    }
  }
});
Important Notes
Access through extendedProps: Custom properties are accessed through the extendedProps object in the event object.
Modifying properties: You can modify custom properties after event creation:
javascript
const event = calendar.getEventById('1');
event.setExtendedProp('format', 'Online');
Searching by custom properties: You can filter events based on custom properties:
javascript
const hybridEvents = calendar.getEvents().filter(
  event => event.extendedProps.format === 'Hybrid'
);
Use with Event Sources: When using event sources, custom properties work the same way:
javascript
events: {
  url: '/calendar/events',
  extraParams: function() {
    return {
      userID: userId
    };
  },
  success: function(events) {
    // Process events if needed
    return events.map(event => ({
      ...event,
      // Add or modify custom properties
      customField: 'value'
    }));
  }
}


Prompt: is INTEGER[] and INT[] the same

Response:
Yes, in PostgreSQL, INTEGER[] and INT[] are functionally the same.
INT is just an alias for INTEGER in PostgreSQL, so both data type declarations create exactly the same type of array. You can use either one according to your preference, and there's no difference in terms of storage, performance, or functionality.


Prompt: In one of my pages, I pass in userID through the API. In this page I include a partial:
<div id="prof-center" class="col-sm-7">
      {{> cal}}
    </div>

This partial uses the userID passed in through the api. how do i reference it in the partial

Response:
To reference the userID passed through your API in a partial, you need to make sure that variable is accessible to the partial template. Here's how you can do it:

In your main handlebars template
When including the partial, you can pass the userID explicitly to the partial:

handlebars
<div id="prof-center" class="col-sm-7">
  {{> cal userId=userID}}
</div>
This syntax passes the userID variable from your main context to the partial as a variable named userId.

In your cal partial template
Now in your cal.hbs (or whatever your partial file is named), you can use the passed variable:

handlebars
<div id="calendar" data-userid="{{userId}}"></div>
This stores the userID as a data attribute on the calendar div, which your JavaScript can then access.

In your JavaScript
Your JavaScript can access this data attribute:

javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const calendarEl = document.getElementById('calendar');
  if (!calendarEl) return;
  
  const userId = calendarEl.getAttribute('data-userid');
  
  // Initialize calendar with userId
  const calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
    // Calendar options...
    events: `calendar/events?userId=${userId}`
  });
  
  calendar.render();
});


Prompt: does fullcalendar js have an availability capability

Response:
FullCalendar.js doesn't have a built-in "availability" capability in the sense of automatically managing free/busy times, but you can implement this functionality yourself using its robust event system. Here are a few approaches:

1. Using Background Events
FullCalendar allows for "background events" which can represent available or unavailable time slots:

javascript
const availabilityEvents = [
  {
    title: 'Available',
    start: '2025-04-10T09:00:00',
    end: '2025-04-10T12:00:00',
    display: 'background',
    color: '#c8e6c9' // light green
  },
  {
    title: 'Unavailable',
    start: '2025-04-10T13:00:00',
    end: '2025-04-10T17:00:00',
    display: 'background',
    color: '#ffcdd2' // light red
  }
];

// Add to your calendar options
events: availabilityEvents
2. Using Business Hours
For regular working hours, you can use the businessHours option:

javascript
businessHours: {
  daysOfWeek: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // Monday - Friday
  startTime: '09:00',
  endTime: '17:00'
}
3. Creating a Custom Availability System
You can build a more comprehensive system by:

Creating special "availability" event types with custom rendering
Implementing conflict checking when new events are created
Using event overlapping rules to prevent booking unavailable times
javascript
// Check if a time slot is available
function isTimeSlotAvailable(startTime, endTime) {
  const calendar = document.getElementById('calendar').FullCalendar;
  const events = calendar.getEvents();
  
  // Filter for busy events (not "available" type)
  const busyEvents = events.filter(event => 
    event.extendedProps.type !== 'available'
  );
  
  // Check for overlaps
  for (const event of busyEvents) {
    if (startTime < event.end && endTime > event.start) {
      return false; // Overlap found, time slot is not available
    }
  }
  
  return true; // No overlaps, time slot is available
}
4. Third-Party Plugins
While not part of core FullCalendar, there are third-party plugins and extensions that add scheduling capabilities:

"fullcalendar-scheduler" (now part of the Premium package) provides resource views that can be used for availability
"Appointment Booking" plugins from various developers
For a complete availability management system, you would typically:

Store user availability preferences in your database
Render these as background events or specially styled regular events
Implement validation to prevent booking unavailable times
Update the calendar in real-time when bookings are made
FullCalendar provides all the building blocks to implement this, but you'll need to create the actual availability logic based on your specific requirements

Recommend how to fix this

Response: 
It looks like you're experiencing MIME type issues when trying to serve your static files. This is a common issue with Express.js websites where the server isn't properly configured to serve static files with the correct MIME types.
Here's how to fix this issue:

First, make sure you've properly set up Express to serve static files. In your index.js file, you need to include:

javascriptconst express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Set up static file serving
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'resources')));

However, based on your project structure, you might need to modify this slightly. Since your static files are inside the resources directory which is inside src, you should use:

javascriptapp.use('/resources', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'resources')));

Make sure you're referencing the files correctly in your Handlebars templates. In your .hbs files, they should be referenced like this:

html<link rel="stylesheet" href="/resources/css/style.css">
<script src="/resources/js/script.js"></script>

Check that your CSS and JS files actually exist at those locations and have content in them.
If you're using a view engine like Handlebars, make sure it's properly configured:

javascript// Set up Handlebars
const exphbs = require('express-handlebars');
app.engine('hbs', exphbs({
  defaultLayout: 'main',
  extname: '.hbs',
  layoutsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'views/layouts')
}));
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
If you've done all this and still have issues, the problem might be that Express is serving your static resource routes as views instead. Double-check that your route handlers aren't capturing these resource URLs and trying to render them as templates.
Would you like me to provide a more complete example of how your index.js file should look?
