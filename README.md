# Tudr - CSCI 3308 Group 012-5

## Project Overview
Tudr is an application that matches students to tutors. Both potential students and tutors will create a profile with select personal and academic information. Students will connect with recommended tutors, and tutors will accept students. Once a student/tutor pair is made, tutoring appointments can be scheduled with a calendar utility.
